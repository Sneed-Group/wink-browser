## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sneed-group/wink-browser.git
   cd wink-browser
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the browser:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Wink Browser supports several command-line options:

- **Regular Mode**: `python main.py [url]`
- **Text-Only Mode**: `python main.py --text-only [url]` (Disables JavaScript for faster, lighter browsing)
- **Private Mode**: `python main.py --private [url]` (No history or cookies saved)
- **Debug Mode**: `python main.py --debug [url]` (Shows detailed debug information)

You can combine these options. For example, to run in both private and text-only mode:
```
python main.py --private --text-only https://example.com
```

### Known Issues and Workarounds

- **SSL Certificate Errors**: If you encounter SSL certificate verification errors, the browser will automatically retry without verification as a fallback. This is not recommended for security-sensitive browsing.
  
- **JavaScript Engine Issues**: The JavaScript engine may occasionally encounter event loop errors. If this happens, try using text-only mode (`--text-only` flag) which disables JavaScript execution.

## Configuration

Wink Browser stores its configuration in `~/.wink_browser/config.json`. This includes:

- General settings (homepage, search engine, etc.)
- Privacy settings (cookie policy, tracking protection)
- Ad blocker settings (filter lists, custom rules)
- Advanced settings (JavaScript, cache size, etc.)
- Extension settings and permissions

## Extensions

Wink Browser supports extensions that can enhance your browsing experience:

### Extension Structure

Extensions are stored in `~/.wink_browser/extensions/` with each extension in its own folder. An extension consists of:

- `extprops.csv`: Defines extension metadata and event handlers
- JavaScript files that handle different browser events

Example `extprops.csv`:
```csv
Key,Value
@name,My Extension
@version,1.0.0
@description,An example extension
@enabled,true

Script,Events
main.js,page_load,dom_ready
link_handler.js,link_click
```

### Extension Security

Extensions run in a secure sandbox with:

- JavaScript code filtering to block potentially harmful patterns
- Limited API access based on permissions
- Event-based architecture to minimize resource usage
- Isolation from the main browser context

### Creating Extensions

To create example extensions, run:
```
python -m browser_engine.extensions.setup_extensions
```
