# Browser Implementation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Script/Style Element Text Display**
   - Fixed the issue where script and style elements were showing their text content
   - Modified the `_render_element_content` method to skip rendering content for script and style elements

2. **CSS Processing**
   - Enhanced CSS handling with a new `_process_all_styles` method
   - Added processing for style elements, inline styles, and external stylesheets
   - Improved error handling for CSS parsing

3. **JavaScript Execution**
   - Added JavaScript engine initialization in the renderer constructor
   - Modified the render method to execute scripts during document rendering
   - Added proper handling for script execution errors

4. **Media and Image Rendering**
   - Completely rewrote the image rendering functionality
   - Added proper image loading with placeholders when images aren't available
   - Improved positioning and sizing of images within their layout boxes
   - Fixed media elements (video/audio) rendering

5. **Scrolling Functionality**
   - Fixed scroll region calculation to properly handle document overflow
   - Added proper mouse wheel handling for scrolling
   - Implemented drag-to-scroll functionality with mouse gestures
   - Added proper scrollbar visibility control

## JavaScript Engine Fixes

1. **Improved Script Content Sanitization**
   - Enhanced the `_sanitize_script_content` method to better handle common JavaScript syntax issues
   - Added HTML comment removal from scripts
   - Added automatic balancing of braces and parentheses
   - Improved error handling in scripts with better try/catch wrappers
   - Added special handling for DuckDuckGo scripts with unterminated if statements

2. **Better Error Reporting**
   - Improved error handling in the `_evaluate_sync` method
   - Added specific handling for JavaScript runtime errors
   - Added context display around error lines to help debug
   - Added more detailed logging of JavaScript errors

3. **External Script Loading**
   - Implemented actual loading of external scripts rather than just logging
   - Added URL resolution for relative script URLs
   - Added proper error handling for script loading failures

4. **Console Object Fixes**
   - Fixed the JavaScript console object implementation
   - Ensured proper binding of console methods to their Python counterparts
   - Fixed the initialization order of JavaScript global objects
   - Made sure console.error calls work properly in error handling

5. **Resource Fetching**
   - Added a dedicated `fetch` method to the NetworkManager for loading resources
   - Added support for different content types (script, style, image)
   - Implemented appropriate headers for each resource type
   - Added proper error handling and logging for resource loading

## Network Manager Improvements

1. **Resource Fetching**
   - Added new `fetch` method to the NetworkManager class for handling different resource types
   - Implemented proper mime-type handling based on resource type
   - Added robust error handling for network requests

These changes should significantly improve the browser's ability to handle JavaScript on modern websites, fix the unterminated statement errors, and enable external script loading for a more complete browsing experience.

## Remaining Issues

Some potential issues that might still need addressing:

1. **Modern JavaScript Features** - The browser may still have issues with cutting-edge JavaScript features
2. **Cross-Origin Restrictions** - Additional CORS handling may be needed
3. **JavaScript Modules** - Support for ES6 modules might need implementation
4. **Performance** - Script evaluation could be optimized further
5. **CSS Loading** - There are still some issues with loading external stylesheets

## Implementation Details

### CSS Processing
The CSS processing now happens in three phases:
1. Process `<style>` elements in the document
2. Process inline style attributes on elements
3. Process external stylesheets

### JavaScript Handling
JavaScript execution now properly happens during document rendering:
1. Initialize a JavaScript engine in the renderer
2. Execute all scripts after processing CSS but before layout generation
3. Handle script loading errors gracefully

### Media Elements
Media elements now render correctly:
1. Images use proper positioning with margins, borders, and padding
2. Images display placeholders while loading
3. Video and audio elements show appropriate controls

### Layout and Rendering
The layout and rendering process now follows this sequence:
1. Process all CSS styles
2. Execute JavaScript
3. Create the layout tree
4. Apply layout calculations
5. Render the content in proper z-index order
6. Update the scroll region for proper scrolling

## Testing
The fixes have been tested with the test_browser.py script to verify:
- Script and style elements are properly processed instead of displayed
- CSS styling is correctly applied to elements
- JavaScript code executes properly
- Media elements display correctly
- Scrolling works as expected
